I could
  ajaxify application.html header and bottom,
  change user's custom style to a partial file,
  OR set user's custom style to a cookie and add them via js.
  that way I could action_cache :layout=>true more oftenly

I could make a 1-1 relationship for a UserData model
  in other to reduce default behaviour of other events on User

I could cache the user followings query params into the user model as a serialized field :)
